# Excel-Automation-Tool

## Description
The development of this product is completely led by myself from design, development, testing and management (CI/CD) as part of the Part-Time work at the Canadian Phycology Centre (CPCC) Biology Lab at University of Wateroo. 
It was initiated by myself with suggestion and presention to the Professor in effort to help the tracking of the Sales & Customers of the Lab. 

## Purpose
This code is to automate the data processing and collection to evaluate the performance of the CPCC Biology Lab in University of Waterloo. 
It eliminates the manual work of collection as the code intends to clean data, construct variables, and run statistical analysis
